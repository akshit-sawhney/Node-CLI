I cannot believe that I am even writing a Readme file for this.

Recently I saw Angular CLI in action. It was really fascinating that how writing just a simple command is
creating a whole lot of things for me. So, I have decided to give it a shot. Maybe this is a humble beginning, but
lets see what I can manage to do with this thing.

Its quite strange how people write such wonderfull and helpful things in their Readme files.
